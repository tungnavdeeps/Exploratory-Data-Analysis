    "# Python Data Analysis (Notebook Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook showcases Python fundamentals used in data analysis workflows, including:\n",
    "- Reading CSV data with pandas\n",
    "- Input validation and basic data quality checks\n",
    "- Filtering by date ranges and computing summary statistics (mean/min/max)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "This project references two datasets:\n",
    "- `15 Years Stock Data of NVDA AAPL MSFT GOOGL and AMZN.csv`\n",
    "- `USA_Housing.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you publish this repo publicly, ensure datasets do not contain private or restricted information.  \n",
    "> If the original datasets are not shareable, include a small sample dataset or instructions to obtain the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run\n",
    "1. Create a Python environment (Python 3.9+ recommended)\n",
    "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "3. Open and run: `analysis.ipynb`\n"

    "If there is a difference in speed between the code it would likely be very marginal. The main difference we would see\n",

    "\n",
    "#Which source code looks like more understandable by a Teaching Assistant? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say both are pretty understandable but the human code would be more understandable for a Teaching Assistant as it is more broken down and consistent compared to the LLM code.\n",
    "My code uses explicit if/elif/else statements while the LLM code uses getattr(filtered) which may not be as explicit or commonly understandable for beginner programmers. My code also has\n",
    "a very clear structure to the input validation from user which would re-prompt when invalid. The LLM's break function may be less obvious to read. Another example would be the calculation.\n",
    "I have broken down the calculation of each selection calculation type while the LLM's code creates a function for the calculation type and input into one and then includes that varible into the\n",
    "filter and calculate. LLM reduces the lines of code needed and compiles the function more compared to my code. Thus, I would say my code is more understandable since it is not compiles and more\n",

    "\n",
    "#Which source code is shorter (ignoring the empty lines)? How do you think that this impacts readibility and execution time of the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both programs are relatively the same size with the LLM using 2 fewer line but also 531 fewer characters to operate. I dont think this would impact the execution time of the program as much but\n",
    "it does highly improve the readability. With similar number of lines and fewer words, the LLM code has compressed the code to execute the same function and uses complex commands which reduced\n",
