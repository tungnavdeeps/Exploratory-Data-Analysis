# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python (Portfolio Notebook)

## What this project shows
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates practical Python skills commonly used in **Data Analyst** and **Business/Banking Analyst** work:

- Loading CSV data with `pandas`
- Validating user inputs (basic data quality checks)
- Filtering time-series data by date range
- Computing summary statistics (mean / min / max)
- Interpreting results in a structured, repeatable workflow

## Notebook
- `analysis.ipynb` — main notebook

## Data
The notebook references:
- `15 Years Stock Data of NVDA AAPL MSFT GOOGL and AMZN.csv`
- `USA_Housing.csv`

If you cannot share the original datasets publicly, you can:
- remove the raw files and include a small `data/sample_*.csv`, or
- add a short “How to obtain the data” note here.

## How to run locally
```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## Portfolio note
This repository is a **modified version of an academic project** adapted for portfolio demonstration (renamed sections, removed course/admin details).  
All analysis, code, and outputs reflect the original work.
